# This is my project for the ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course module 4 by Metacrafters.

- This is a ERC20 token contract build using the solidity programming language.
  
- We can connect it with MetaMask wallet by selecting the environment as "Injected Web3" to connect Remix to our MetaMask wallet.
  
- By changing the network in MetaMask to the "Avalanche Fuji Testnet", we can use this token for transactions i.e
  - mint
  - send
  - redeem
  - burn, etc.
    
- This token contract is build using the templates from the OpenZeppelin library.

- My token name is PirateShip and it's symbol is PSP.

- I have already minted 10000 token.
  
- We can copy paste the code on Remix IDE at https://remix.ethereum.org/. and can deploy this contract.
